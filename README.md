<h2>Project 2 Team:</h2>
<ul><li>Dan Freda</li>
  <li>Banu Nathan</li>
  <li>Fleming Brathwaite</li>
  <li>Shawntell Manning</li></ul>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<ol><li>Your task is to tell a story using data visualizations.</li>
<li>Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.</li>
<li>Prepare a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization.</li>
<li>You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly.</li>
<li>You will have ample time in class to work with your group, but expect to put in hours outside of class as well.</li></ol>

<h2>Project Requirements:</h2>
<ol><li>Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).</li>
<li>Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:<br>
<ul><li>A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)</li>
<li>A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly</li>
<li>A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data</li>
<li>A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)</li></ul></li>
<li>project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.</li>
<li>project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.</li>
<li>project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).</li>
<li>Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.</li></ol>

<h2>Project Proposal:</h2>
<p>Our project will involve creating a visualization of volcanic activity worldwide.</p>
